# Project Statement

This project is a simple command-line based Expense Tracker written in
Python.\
It allows users to record income and expenses, view transaction history,
delete entries, and keep track of a running balance.
All data is stored in a CSV file named **expense_tracker.csv**.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-understand example
of: - Reading and writing CSV files in Python
- Creating a menu-driven console application
- Maintaining a running balance
- Working with basic data structures

This project is designed to be simple, readable, and beginner-friendly.
